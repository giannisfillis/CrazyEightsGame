# CrazyEights Game

- RULES: The game is played with one deck of cards. The deck is shuffled, 5 cards are dealt to each player and a card is thrown on the table. The players play one after the other, and each player in his turn, if he has one card that matches either the suit or the number of the last thrown card, he throws it on the table. If he has a card with the number 8, he can throw it at any time, and he determines its color (which may be different from that of the card). If he doesn't have any matching cards then he draws a card from the deck and loses his turn. If the pile of cards drawn by the players runs out, then we put the discarded cards back into the deck and shuffle. Whoever runs out of cards first wins the game.

- Number of players between 2 and 7.
- If you want to run the game, just compile and run the Game.java file.
